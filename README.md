Dissertation.pdf is my master' thesis.

tensor_operation.py contains functions operated on tensor in order to implement mode_k product with matrix and mode_k unfolding.

my_method.py inplements proposed estimation methods in my dissertation.

TOPUP.py inplements TOPUP proposed by (Chen, Yang, and Zhang, 2019)

data_generation.py is used to generate data that satisfy different experimental settings.

experiment_design.py contains functions to run simulations and constructs evaluation metrics.

Simulation.ipynb is to apply the aforementioned python files and run the whole simulation under different experimental settings.

Note that the python notebook is written using Google Colab.
